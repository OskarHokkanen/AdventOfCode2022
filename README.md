# AdventOfCode2022
Advent of code challenge @https://adventofcode.com/2022/


These are my solutions for Advent of Code 2022
I don't have that much experience in python or in AoC events so this will be my first 'serious' try. 

NOTE:
I want to thank [Jonathan Paulson](https://www.youtube.com/@jonathanpaulson5053). Found his solutions on youtube. I learn a lot by comparing my solutions to his.
