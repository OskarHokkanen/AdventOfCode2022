# AdventOfCode2022
Advent of code challenge @https://adventofcode.com/2022/


These are my solutions for Advent of Code 2022
I don't have that much experience in python or in AoC events so this will be my first 'serious' try. 

NOTE:
I want to thank [Betaveros](https://github.com/betaveros). Found him on the leaderboard. I learn a lot by comparing my solutions to his.
